                <h2>BasketBall</h2>
                <p>Basketball is a sport that takes great endurance, competence, and team spirit to outscore other teams and win the game. This Game has not only been a hobby of mine but I've not only played for the school team but also local clubs throughout my upbringing.</p>
                <h3>Position</h3>
                <p>I'm a Point Guard. PG are known to control the flow of the game by bringing the ball up and setting up plays to look for opportunities inside the key. They tend to be shorter than their teammates therefore, they stay outwards and shoot rather than driving in.</p>
                <h3>Favourite Player</h3>
                <p>My favorite player is Steph Curry who plays for the Golden State Warriors. I took a liking to his style because like myself he isn't as tall as his peers and teammates hence causing him to have to train and play harder. Steph Curry is known for his ability to shoot "3's" from almost anywhere on the court.  </p>

            <h2>BasketBall Facts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The first basketballs were colored brown. However, a brown ball can be difficult for both players and fans to see. To increase ball visibility, Coach Tony Hinkle of Butler University came up with an idea to develop an orange ball in 1957.</li>
                <li>he league we now know as the NBA was originally called the Basketball Association of America (BAA) and was founded on June 6, 1946. Following a merger with rival National Basketball League on August 3, 1949, it changed its name to the National Basketball Association.</li>
                <li>The first three-point shot in the National Basketball Association (NBA) was made by Boston Celtics guard Chris Ford on October 12, 1979, against the Houston Rockets. This was the same game that marked the debut of Celtics legend Larry Bird.</li>
                <li>Stephen Curry is a two-time NBA MVP and three-time champion with the Golden State Warriors. However, his legacy goes beyond these lofty accomplishments. He is also widely credited for changing the game of basketball by inspiring players at all levels to utilize the 3-point shot regularly. A late bloomer in terms of physical stature, he developed a playing style that would suit his frame and used exceptional basketball IQ to outwit the opposition while turning his teammates into better players.</li>
